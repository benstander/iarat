In partcular, this “rule” relies on aninput and generates an output.You can think of a function as a machine:We input something (like a number) into the machineThe machine processes the input, based on the ruleThe machine produces an outputAs a diagram, the process looks like:-Chris Tisdell (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=labYpqU37Qg&list=PLGCj8f6sgswnyu1woFWmYtT1N_Kc8WCNw&index=1)Functions4 / 16Why do we need functions?Functions are a bit like formulas - they help use to understand, model andsolve problems. Functions tell us the relationship between things and howone thing depends on another.As a basic example, consider a square. We know the relationship betweenthe length of a side and the area of the square:Area of square = (length of side)2that is, the area of a square depends on the length of its sides. This is afunctional relationship.We can formalize this is little more. Let x be the length of the side and letthe corresponding area of the square be y . We thus have the functiony = A(x) = x 2 .The x is the input; y = A(x) is output; and A is the “squared” operation.Chris Tisdell (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=labYpqU37Qg&list=PLGCj8f6sgswnyu1woFWmYtT1N_Kc8WCNw&index=1)Functions5 / 16Function notationIn mathematics, we commonly use the notation:x to denote the input - the independent variablef to represent the function (or rule)f (x) to represent to output- the dependent variable.Examples include:1; f (x) = sin x;xFunctions can also be expressed by graphs.f (x) = x 3 ;f (x) =f (x) = 2x 2 - 4x + 1.Chris Tisdell (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=labYpqU37Qg&list=PLGCj8f6sgswnyu1woFWmYtT1N_Kc8WCNw&index=1)Functions6 / 16Ways of representing functionsFunctions can be expressed:algebraically, through y = f (x)visually, through graphing the set of points (x, f (x)) in the plane.Chris Tisdell (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=labYpqU37Qg&list=PLGCj8f6sgswnyu1woFWmYtT1N_Kc8WCNw&index=1)Functions7 / 16Domain, codomain and range of a functionFunctionA function f : A → B is a rule that connects each x ∈ A with exactly oneelement y ∈ B. The A and B are suitable sets:(a)A is known as the domain of f and denoted by Dom(f ).(b)B is known as the codomain of f and denoted by Codom(f ).(c)the set of all y values produced by the function f is called the rangeof f and denoted by Range(f ).Domain and range give important information that is designed to ensurethat any work performed with the function is well–defined and can be usedto learn more about how the function behaves, eg, for graphing purposes.Chris Tisdell (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=labYpqU37Qg&list=PLGCj8f6sgswnyu1woFWmYtT1N_Kc8WCNw&index=1)Functions8 / 16Domain, codomain and rangeThe domain of a function gives us a set of “allowable” inputs.The range of a function gives us a set of achieved outputs.The co-domain is an announcement of everything that the function mightproduce.The range is what actually is produced.ExampleDetermine the domain, codomain and range of the function f : R → Rdefined byf (x) := x 2 + 2.Evaluate f (1) and f (w - 3).Chris Tisdell (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=labYpqU37Qg&list=PLGCj8f6sgswnyu1woFWmYtT1N_Kc8WCNw&index=1)Functions9 / 16Example: Restricting the domainConsider the function f : (-1, 6) → R defined byf (x) := x 2 + 2.Sketch the graph of f and determine its domain, codomain and range.Chris Tisdell (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=labYpqU37Qg&list=PLGCj8f6sgswnyu1woFWmYtT1N_Kc8WCNw&index=1)Functions10 / 16ExampleCompute the domain and range of the function defined byf (x) := √1.x +3Chris Tisdell (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=labYpqU37Qg&list=PLGCj8f6sgswnyu1woFWmYtT1N_Kc8WCNw&index=1)Functions11 / 16ExampleConsider the “split” function f defined by 8x + 1, for x > 1;f (x) :=7 - 2x, for x ≤ 1.Compute f (0), f (1), f (3). Determine its domain, codomain and range.Chris Tisdell (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=labYpqU37Qg&list=PLGCj8f6sgswnyu1woFWmYtT1N_Kc8WCNw&index=1)Functions12 / 16Relations vs FunctionsIf a rule produces multiple y values for a single x value we call it a relationrather than a function. It is always a worry to be sorting through multiplepossible y -values for relations which are not functions, however we cancope with it if necessary.Vertical Line TestA relation is a function if a vertical line crosses its graph at most once.Chris Tisdell (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=labYpqU37Qg&list=PLGCj8f6sgswnyu1woFWmYtT1N_Kc8WCNw&index=1)Functions13 / 16ExampleWhich of the following pass the vertical line test?x2 + y2 = 9y = 2x - 6√y = x + 3.Chris Tisdell (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=labYpqU37Qg&list=PLGCj8f6sgswnyu1woFWmYtT1N_Kc8WCNw&index=1)Functions14 / 16Two functions may be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided in theusual way. Two functions can be combined via an operation known ascomposition. It is defined as follows.CompositionThe composition of f with g is defined viaf ◦ g (x) = f (g (x)).Order of operations matterNote thatf ◦ g 6= g ◦ fin general, so the order of operations matter.Chris Tisdell (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=labYpqU37Qg&list=PLGCj8f6sgswnyu1woFWmYtT1N_Kc8WCNw&index=1)Functions15 / 16ExampleIf f (x) = x 2 and g (x) = cos(x) then determine f ◦ g and g ◦ f .Chris Tisdell (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=labYpqU37Qg&list=PLGCj8f6sgswnyu1woFWmYtT1N_Kc8WCNw&index=1)Functions16 / 16",
